# PyBer_Challenge

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to come up with a summarized DataFrame of our ride-sharing data that was broken out by city type (rural, urban, and suburban). Our DataFrame specifically looked at the date range of 1/1/19 - 4/28/19. After completing that, we created a multiple-line chart that showed the total weekly fares for each city type over our date range.

## Results
The first step in our analysis was to merge our two data files by the "city" column into one set of data. From there were were able to use code to determine our total ride count, total driver count, total fare amount, average fare per ride, and average far per driver. We got all of this data and then broke it out by our three city types. We were able to create a DataFrame using all of this data which made it easier to read.
